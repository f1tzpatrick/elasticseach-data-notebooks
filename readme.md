# Elasticsearch Usage Data Analysis

Run `get-data.sh` to get data (lol) from elasticsearch.

Use the notebooks (`.ipynb`) & helper functions in `python/` to import data into pandas `DataFrames`.

Calculate statistics and more with python, pandas, and matplotlib. The jupyter notebook integration with VS Code is great!
